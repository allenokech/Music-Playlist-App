# Music Playlist App

## Contents
This is where all the documentation for the project will be:

### Introduction
### Brief
To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training.

In order to do this, the follwowing is required:
- Trello board or equivalent with a full project backlog 
- Relational database compromising at least two tables 
- Clear documentation highlighting the architecture of the project
- A comprehensive risk assessment
- Fully designed test suites including automated testing
- Functioning CRUD application created in Python
- Functioning front-end website created in Flask
- Full integration into GitHub

#### My Proposition
To achieve this, I decided to create a simple music playlist application that allows users to create playlists, add, update and delete songs within those playlists.
The application must allow the user to do the following:
- Create:
  - Playlist Name
  - Song Title
  - Artist Name
  - Release Year
- Read:
  - Playlists that have been created
- Update:
  - Playlists (playlist name, song information)
- Delete:
  - Songs from playlists
  - Playlists

### Architecture
#### Database Structure
Below is an entity relationship diagram (ERD) showcasing the structure of the database. 

### Project Tracking
This is where the project backlog is stored, highlighting each individual task broken down from the project epic. User stories have also been documented to emphasise the key functions expected from the CRUD application from the users' perspective.

### Risk Assessment
